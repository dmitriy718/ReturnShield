## 1. Agenda Slide (30 seconds)
1. Introduce yourself.
2. Restate the buyer’s pain point using their numbers (“You’re refunding 18% of orders…”).
3. Share agenda: “I’ll show the dashboard tour, the automation planner, and how pricing unlocks live data.”

## 2. Dashboard Guided Tour (5 minutes)
| Time | Action | Script |
| --- | --- | --- |
| :30 | Reveal summary cards | “Once you connect Shopify, these KPIs update automatically—this trial environment uses sample data until billing is active.” |
| 1:30 | Reveal Returnless Intelligence | “Here’s the SKU leaderboard. Even while blurred you can see the actions we recommend. When you activate, the blur disappears and syncs nightly.” |
| 2:30 | Reveal AI Exchange Coach | “Exchange Coach ranks plays by margin at risk. Operators click the card, follow the steps, and watch the uplift metric climb.” |
| 3:30 | Reveal VIP Hub | “VIP queue keeps loyalty-rich tickets visible so no high-value shopper slips through.” |
| 4:30 | Reveal Billing preview | “Final step of the tour points straight to plans. Launch unblurs data, Scale unlocks automation, Elite adds a strategist.” |

Close the tour by pointing to the **Quick start checklist** and **Resource library** panels.

---

## 3. Exchange Automation (2 minutes)
1. Switch to the **Automation** tab.
2. Explain saved inputs: “Your values persist per user, so your team doesn’t retype them daily.”
3. Click **Generate playbook** and read one recommendation aloud.
4. Use **Reset to defaults** to demonstrate quick cleanup.

---

## 4. Billing & Success Path (2 minutes)
1. Open the **Billing** tab and reference the status banner.
2. Walk through plan cards—call out “Recommended” badge on Scale for Shopify operators.
3. Click **Start subscription** (don’t complete checkout) to show Stripe appears instantly.
4. Mention post-checkout page and concierge onboarding link.

## 5. Objection Fast Answers
| Objection | Response |
| --- | --- |
| “What data do I see pre-purchase?” | “Sample data stays blurred until you pay—no surprise numbers. Guided tour ensures you know where everything lives before activation.” |
| “How long does setup take?” | “Quick start checklist outlines each step. Typical brand goes live in under 72 hours once Shopify is connected.” |
| “Can my team revisit the tour?” | “Yes—**Replay guided tour** button in the header resets it for anyone.” |
| “How do I share learnings internally?” | “Resource library links to the marketing plan, operator playbook, and billing checklist.” |

Keep this table nearby during Q&A.

## 6. Call to Action & Follow-Up (1 minute)
1. Ask for the commitment: “Ready to activate Launch so we can unblur your data?”
2. Offer to send concierge onboarding link for white-glove setup.
3. Email follow-up within 15 minutes:
   - Meeting recap (bullet points).
   - Links to `docs/marketing-assets.md` and `docs/operator-playbook.md`.
   - Next step (e.g., “Complete checkout” or “Connect Shopify store”).

---

## 7. Post-Demo Log (2 minutes)
1. Update outreach tracker (contact status, notes, next step).
2. Capture any new objections or feature requests in a shared doc.
3. If demo felt bumpy, replay the guided tour once more to re-familiarise yourself.

**Reminder:** Demos aren’t about showing every pixel—they’re about proving that ReturnShield solves refund leakage quickly. Stick to the script, leverage the guided tour, and always land with a clear ask.
