# Work Log – 2025-11-12

## 07:58 UTC – Session start
- Reviewed running containers and compose configuration.
- Goal: backend/frontend enhancements while user resting; prep for upcoming BigCommerce/WooCommerce keys.
- Tasks queued: eliminate staticfiles warning, add platforms status API + marketing UI consumption, run tests, redeploy.

## 08:01 UTC
- Created `backend/static/.gitkeep` so `STATICFILES_DIRS` target exists and Django stops warning on restart.

## 08:10 UTC
- Added `backend/core/views.py` with `PlatformStatusView` returning Shopify/BigCommerce/WooCommerce availability metadata.
- Wired new endpoint at `GET /api/platforms/status/` in `core/urls.py`.
- Wrote `core/tests.py::PlatformStatusViewTests` to ensure response structure and CTA data.

## 08:25 UTC
- Frontend now defines `defaultIntegrationHighlights` and loads live data from `/api/platforms/status/` via new effect; results hydrate CTA badges dynamically.
- Added `IntegrationHighlight` type and local state tied to API payload, preserving UTMs for analytics.

## 08:32 UTC
- Ran backend tests on VPS container (`python manage.py test core billing`) – all green.
- `npm run build` for marketing site passes after refactor.

## 08:34 UTC
- Removed deprecated `version` stanza from `docker-compose.yml` to silence Compose v2 warnings during deploys.

## 08:40 UTC
- Pushed changes to GitHub (`94d8543`).
- Pulled on VPS and rebuilt backend/frontend containers via `docker compose` v2.
- Confirmed backend startup is clean (staticfiles warning resolved) and services healthy.

## 08:55 UTC
- Extended dashboard (`app-frontend`) to show live platform availability using the new `/api/platforms/status/` endpoint.
- Added `PlatformStatus` types, default fallbacks, and client-side fetch with graceful degradation.
- Styled the "Connect additional storefronts" panel and recompiled `app-frontend` build.
