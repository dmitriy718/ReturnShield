# ReturnShield Go-to-Market Plan

This plan is written in clear steps so you can follow it one move at a time.

---

## 1. Know Who We Serve
- **Primary buyer:** Director / VP of Operations or CX at Shopify brands processing 3k–40k orders per month.
- **Pain we solve:** Refund leakage, reverse logistics costs, unhappy VIP customers.
- **Proof points to highlight:** 23% average refund-rate reduction, $48k median revenue protected monthly, live VIP resolution queue.

---

## 2. Polish Our Story (Simple Script)
1. **Problem:** “Returns eat money and disappoint loyal customers.”
2. **Solution:** “ReturnShield shows *why* returns happen and automates exchanges + keep-it refunds.”
3. **Result:** “Brands defend tens of thousands in margin every month.”
4. **Call-to-action:** “See a 15-minute walkthrough” → `https://app.returnshield.app/register`

Practice this script aloud three times before every conversation. Keep it short and friendly.

---

## 3. Core Assets To Use
- **Marketing site:** `https://returnshield.app` (hero metrics, feature breakdown).
- **Dashboard demo:** `https://app.returnshield.app` (use a demo login when ready).
- **One-pager PDF:** Export homepage as PDF for email attachments.
- **Stripe checkout:** Uses live price IDs—always test with the provided checkout buttons after major changes.

---

## 4. Outreach Channels (Week 1–4)
1. **Existing network (Day 1–3)**
   - DM operators you already know.
   - Send the simple script + screenshot of dashboard insights.
   - Goal: 5 live demos booked.
2. **Shopify ecosystem (Day 4–14)**
   - Post LinkedIn threads on refund wins with #ShopifyOps.
   - Join Shopify community forums → Share “23% refund reduction” case snippets.
   - Offer a 30-day pilot to agencies handling returns.
3. **Retention newsletters (Day 10–21)**
   - Pitch guest content (“How to turn refunds into exchanges”) to CX newsletters (e.g., DTC Newsletter, CX Chronicles).
   - Include CTA linking to `https://app.returnshield.app/register`.
4. **Paid tests (Optional, Day 21–30)**
   - Run retargeting ads on LinkedIn against site visitors.
   - Creative: ROI ticker + CTA “See live exchange savings”.

Track every outreach in a simple Google Sheet: columns for name, channel, last touch, next step.

---

## 5. Demo Flow (Step-by-Step)
1. **Kickoff (1 minute)**
   - Ask: “What’s your current monthly return rate and average order value?”
2. **Show dashboard (7 minutes)**
   - Insights overview → AI Exchange Coach → VIP queue.
   - Tie each module back to their numbers.
3. **Checkout CTA (1 minute)**
   - Click pricing button → show Stripe checkout page.
4. **Close**
   - Offer concierge onboarding (`?concierge=1` link) if they need white-glove setup.

Always finish by sending them the operator playbook (see `docs/operator-playbook.md`).

---

## 6. Daily Marketing Routine (15 minutes)
1. Post one social update (LinkedIn or Twitter) sharing a dashboard insight.
2. Send two follow-up emails to leads.
3. Answer one community question about returns.
4. Log all activity in the outreach tracker.

Consistency beats volume. Keep doing these steps every weekday.

---

## 7. Metrics To Watch
- **Top funnel:** Website sessions and demo form starts (via PostHog + Stripe checkout hits).
- **Middle funnel:** Demo calls booked per week.
- **Bottom funnel:** Stripe subscription conversions and churn.

Review numbers every Monday morning. Adjust outreach channels if demos <4/week.
